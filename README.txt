FEATURES OF XCOM MULTIMOD
***************************************

This mod is a sequel of the XCOM Multimod, from the perspective of the Aliens. Now, these are the "Resistance", while the humans are the "Aliens".

Human UFOs equivalent to Terror Ship, Fighter and scouts.
Some old alien "UFOs" now are playable.
Changes to the dynamics of the game. The wounding effects are different, in fact, no one dies inmediately from limbs wounds, but if the wounds are so severe, the unit will fall unconscious and it could lost some time or firing points from his or her stats.
All damage is "flat"; there is no "zero" damage, but critical hits to body parts.
Some new alien weapons and technologies.
Laser weapons are RECHARGABLE after finish the mission and they don't dissapears after depleat the energy.
Psionics attacks requires special training, not only psi skills.
New base maps with alien-looking.
New base maps for the humans (IA).
Maps for martian cities.
New maps for Mars terrains.
You can use some aliens from original XCOM and they could be "upgraded".

And more...

I hope you like it. You can use it or it's parts as you want, but be careful with the third-party material.

P.D.

Use the resources wisely. Even Elerium and alloys are scarce.
